# 2D Linear Regression from scratch with Python

---

# Overview

This is a bibliographic dive into the basics of machine learning (ML) and how it actually works under the hoods of all available frameworks (sklearn, tf, pytorch, ...)

This code is basically not mine, I copy pasted and got inspired from a couple of sources, which I'll be listing in the references section of this README.

It's a simple class that contains functions for random linear data genration, external data importing, and linear regression with two methods:

- Gradient descent (iterative method).

- Best slope and intercept (instant method).

This code is for 2D linear regression, these methods get a bit complicated when implemented for dimensions higher than 2 (basically once we stop looking for lines and we switch to hyper planes ("lines" in multi-dimensions, example: a 2D-plane is a 3D-space hyper-plane, ...).

I might be implementing a Pseudo-inverse method for multi-dimensional linear regression (instant method) in the future.

## Edit

I implemented the MultiD_LinearRegression class and used it for two examples.

I didn't go thoroughly into the math of it since the references I listed are just perfect (at least they are in my opinion)
